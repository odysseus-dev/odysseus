# Contributing to Odysseus

Thanks for helping. The project is moving quickly, so the best contributions are focused, easy to review, and easy to test.

## Before You Start

- Search existing issues and pull requests before opening a new one.
- Prefer one bug fix or feature per pull request.
- Avoid broad rewrites, formatting-only changes, or moving many files unless the issue is specifically about structure.
- If you want to work on a large feature, open an issue first and describe the approach.

## Setup

Docker is the recommended path for normal testing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus.git
cd odysseus
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up -d --build
```

Manual development uses Python 3.11+:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000
```

Windows is not actively tested. Docker on Linux or a Linux/macOS manual install is the safer path for now.

## Running Checks

Run the smallest relevant checks for your change:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m py_compile app.py routes/*.py src/*.py
node --check static/js/<file-you-changed>.js
```

For Docker-related changes:

```bash
docker compose config
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs --tail=120 odysseus
```

Mention what you ran in the pull request description. If you could not run a check, say so.

## Pull Requests

Good pull requests usually include:

- A short explanation of the bug or feature.
- The files or areas changed.
- Manual test steps or automated test results.
- Screenshots or short recordings for UI changes.
- Links to related issues, for example `Fixes #123`.

Please keep PRs small. Large PRs that mix unrelated cleanup, formatting, refactors, and behavior changes are much harder to review.

Always link the issue your PR fixes (`Fixes #123`). PRs with no linked issue are hard to triage and may be closed.

### Keeping your PR mergeable

`main` moves quickly, so the most common reason a finished, correct PR stalls is a **stale branch**. Before opening a PR — and again after each round of review — rebase onto the latest `main` and confirm your diff contains only your own files:

```bash
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git diff origin/main..HEAD --name-only   # should list ONLY the files you intended to change
```

If that command lists files you never touched, your branch is stale and is silently reverting already-merged work — rebase until the list is clean. A clean two-dot diff is the difference between a quick review and a back-and-forth.

## Issue Reports

For bugs, include:

- Install method: Docker, manual Python, WSL, etc.
- OS, browser, and device if relevant.
- Exact steps to reproduce.
- Expected behavior and actual behavior.
- Logs, screenshots, or terminal output.

For model-serving issues, include:

- Backend: Ollama, vLLM, SGLang, llama.cpp, LM Studio, etc.
- Model name.
- GPU/CPU and operating system.
- Cookbook task logs or server logs.

Issues with only "help", "does not work", or a screenshot without context may be closed as not actionable.

## Security

Do not post secrets, API keys, private logs, personal documents, or public IPs in issues or pull requests.

For security reports, follow [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
