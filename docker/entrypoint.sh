# update them — silently breaking skill extraction, prefs saves, mail
# attachments, etc.

# Standard PUID/PGID pattern: pick the UID/GID we should drop to,
# chown the writable bind-mounts so existing root-owned content gets
# repaired on every start (idempotent), then exec the real command
# as that user via gosu.
